# Classic Arcade Game - Udacity FEND Project

```
A classic arcade game clone similar to frogger. The player must get from the start position to the end 
avoiding all enemy bugs. If the player hits the bugs the game is over and you must start again. 
If you reach the end you will be told your final score.
